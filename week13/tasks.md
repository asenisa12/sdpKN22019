# **Graphs**

### **Task 1:**
    Implement class named DWGraph representing directed weighted graph

### **Task 2:**
    Implement member function areConnected(int vertex1, int vertex2)
    that checks if there is path between vertex1 and vertex2

### **Task 3:**
    Implement member function printKSmallest(int vertex1, int vertex2, int K)
    that prints the K paths with smallest weight
