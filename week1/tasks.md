# **Stack**

### **Task 1:**
    Implement two stacks in an array
    Create a data structure twoStacks that represents two stacks. Implementation of twoStacks should use only one array, i.e., both stacks should use the same array for storing elements. Following functions must be supported by twoStacks.
    push1(int x) –> pushes x to first stack
    push2(int x) –> pushes x to second stack

    pop1() –> pops an element from first stack and return the popped element
    pop2() –> pops an element from second stack and return the popped element



### **Task 2:**
    Design a stack which, in addition to push and pop, has a function min which returns the minimum element. Push, pop and min should all operate in 0(1) time.


### **Task 3:**
    Design a stack with the following operations: 
        1) push() which adds an element to the top of stack.
        2) pop() which removes an element from top of stack.
        3) findMiddle() which will return middle element of the stack.
