### **Task 1:**
    Implement operator[] and Iterator object to a given linked list implementation

### **Task 2:**
    Write code to partition a linked list around a value x,
    such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x.

    Example
    Input:
        x=5
        list = {4,6,7,3,6,4,7}
    Output:
        list ={4,3,4,6,7,6,7}

### **Task 3:**
    You have two numbers represented by a std::list, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1 's digit is at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list. 
    Example 
    Input: (7-> 1 -> 6) + (5 -> 9 -> 2).Thatis,617 + 295. 
    Output: 2 - > 1 - > 9. That is, 912.
