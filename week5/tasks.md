### **Task 1:**
    Implement Queue using two std::stack-s 

### **Task 2:**
    Reverse list made from 'node' structures (not encpsulated in class)
                * by using std::stack
                * by pushing at the beginning of the list
### **Task 2:**
    Remove every Nth element from:
        * list made from 'node' structures (not encpsulated in class)
                * by using recursion
                * by using iterator
        * std::list




## Homework
        1) Implement Stack using two std::queue-s

        2) Create class List(Snigly Linked) with:
                * constructor List(int N), which during initialization fills the list with the numbers from 0 to N
                * push() and pop() functions
                * function that prints its elements
                * function reverse() that reverses the list using std::stack (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reverse-a-stack-using-recursion/)
                * function removebigger(int N) that removes every element bigger than N
