# **Binary trees**

### **Task 1:**
    Check Balanced: Implement a function to check if a binary tree is balanced. For the purposes of
    this question, a balanced tree is defined to be a tree such that the heights of the two subtrees of any
    node never differ by more than one.

### **Task 2:**
    Check Subtree: Tl and T2 are two very large binary trees, with Tl much bigger than T2. Create an
    algorith m to determine if T2 is a subtree of Tl .
    A tree T2 is a subtree ofTi if there exists a node n in Ti such that the subtree of n is identical to T2.
    That is, if you cut off the tree at node n, the two trees would be identical.

### **Task 3:**
    Implement a function to check if a binary tree is a binary search tree.


### **Task 4:**
