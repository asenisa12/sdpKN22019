# **Binary trees**

### **Task 1:**
    Get value of leaf specified by vector of LeafId

### **Task 2:**
    Given a sorted (increasing order) array with unique integer elements, write an lgorithm to generate a binary search tree with minimal height

### **Task 3:**
    Calculate the expression represented by binary tree (only * and + should be supporeted)
    For example: 
       '+'
       / \
     '1' '*'
         / \
        '1' '2'  shold give us 1+(1*2)

### **Task 4:**
    You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value (which might be positive or negative). Design an algorithm to count the number of paths that sum to a given value. The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (traveling only from parent nodes to ch ild nodes)

### **Task 5:**
    Assume that the given binary tree is binary search tree. Implement function that removes element by value
